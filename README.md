## Description

This repository hosts code in which we:
(1) load, parse, and lemmatize entries from a TEI-XML edition of Ruland's dictionary available from [here](https://github.com/sarahalang/alchemical-dictionaries/tree/main)
(2) detect all these entries in the [EMLAP](https://zenodo.org/records/14765511) corpus of Early Modern Latin Alchemical Prints
(3) load these data into a web app allowing to visualize temporal distribution of the detected instances
(4) conduct additional analyses of the data
